# analog_keyboard_overlay

This is a browser plugin overlay for [OBS Studio][e148b553]. This overlay displays (virtual)controller axes as a keyboard for those who want to show off their analog keyboards on stream/recordings.

## Methods used to read analog input:

The analog input is read from [Navigator.getGamepads()][ebc9fbee]. Reading axis from any connected controller with axes and displaying the values in [HTML5 Canvas][b68cfb52].

The current limitations of the browser scope is that this overlay can only read analog info in the background, keystrokes do not fire. A way around this issue is to bind your keystrokes to controller keys/axes and simulating them as keys in the overlay.
